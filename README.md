 🎓 GradeWizard – Student Grade Manager**

🔍 Project Description

GradeWizard** is a dynamic web application designed to help users efficiently manage and track student grades. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, GradeWizard allows users to input student names and scores, automatically calculates letter grades, and displays all students in an interactive list.

The project is a practical demonstration of modern JavaScript skills, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, array operations, and responsive user interface design.
